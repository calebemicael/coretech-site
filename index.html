          <h2>Machine Learning applied to the Design of Integrated Circuits</h2>
          
            <p>The development of tools to aid the design of integrated circuits must deal with various optimization problems with multiple cost functions.</p>
            <p>With the increase in the scale of integration of integrated circuits, new methodologies, algorithms, and data structures are needed to assist the synthesis flow of integrated circuits.</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been an increase in the search for solutions combining machine learning techniques.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we will discuss the main synthesis flow tools, their optimization objectives, the dependence on graph-based data structures, the main contemporary challenges, and how machine learning techniques can be applied to help the integrated circuit synthesis flow achieve lower cost solutions and reduce design time.</p>
            <p>The challenges of integrating Machine Learning and trends in the field will also be highlighted.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to Chip Design Automation (EDA)</h2>
          <p>The design of contemporary VLSI circuits (chips), made up of dozens of general-purpose processors and dedicated processors, and with billions of transistors, requires the use of strict methodologies, based on the intensive use of EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.</p>
          <p>These tools, in turn, form a design flow that generally takes a top-down approach, starting with the description of system-level behavior, followed by architectural design, functional design, logic synthesis, technology mapping, and ending with physical design.</p>
          <p>Each of these stages receives a description at a given level of abstraction and automatically produces a new system description by adding functional and/or structural details, so that the final description can be used to manufacture the chip.</p>
          <p>In addition, the description generated at each stage also needs to be validated using verification techniques before moving on in the design flow.</p>
          <p>This course will cover the types of description used and the synthesis and verification processes carried out at each stage, as well as the associated EDA tools.</p>
          <p>The challenges of developing EDA tools for chip design in current and future technologies will also be addressed.</p>

Between 2017 and 2019 he was coordinator of the Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGCC) at UFSC. Between 2002 and 2007, he was an adjunct professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel).</p>

            <p>He is a senior member of the IEEE. He is a member of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, the IEEE Computer Society (CS), the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS), the IEEE Council for Electronic Design Automation (CEDA), the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and the Brazilian Microelectronics Society (SBMicro), of which he was a board member in 2006-2008.

            <h2>Trends in Computing and Microelectronics</h2>
            <p>The talk will cover some trends in Computing and Microelectronics, such as processor architectures, energy-saving strategies, optimization, critical systems, automated design, fault tolerance, embedded systems, alternative architectures (such as quantum systems, systemic systems) and hardware accelerators. Special emphasis will be placed on strategic technologies for the Internet of Things.</p>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) demands new challenges in the design of computing and electronic devices. One of the main challenges is reducing energy consumption, which has grown enormously as a result of the increasing number of devices connected to the internet, most of which are permanently connected. An overview will be given of design strategies (from software to component level) to reduce energy consumption, as well as to increase the reliability of IoT components, such as reducing the number of components in IoT devices. Optimization is a key word in the design of IT components in the IoT era.</p>
            <h2>Visualization tools </h2>
            <p>EDA (electronic design automation) tools have paved the way for the integration of billions of components into a single integrated circuit. However, many EDA tools still rely on text interfaces. The use of visualization tools helps not only to provide a visual output from an EDA tool, but also to show the tool's performance in terms of the quality of the results. Good graphical output is useful for improving algorithms or developing new ones. The talk is illustrated with several examples and animations, especially some logic cell positioning visualization tools. A perspective is provided on how these visualization tools have contributed to the improvement and development of new algorithms developed by our research team.</p>

      <p>
        The IEEE Circuits and Systems Society is the leading organization that
        promotes the advancement of the theory, analysis, computer-aided design
        and practical implementation of circuits, and the application of circuit
        theoretic techniques systems and signal processing.The Society brings
        engineers, researchers, scientists and others involved in circuits and
        systems applications access to the industry’s most essential technical
        information, networking opportunities, career development tools, and
        many other exclusive benefits. Members with similar technical interests
        engage in professional exchange through the Society’s more than 100
        local chapters in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East,
        Africa, Latin America, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership includes Society Newsletter (electronic), IEEE Circuits and
        Systems Magazine (electronic and print), IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal
        (electronic), IEEE Circuits and Systems Society Digital Library, and
        Conference Digital Library (electronic).
      </p>
      <p>
        Circuits and Systems Society membership covers one calendar year,
        beginning on 1 January and ending on 31 December. Professionals can join
        at any time during the calendar year and fees are prorated based on the
        month in which membership begins through the end of the calendar year.

        are listed below from Brazilian people:
      </p>
      <p>
        Student member: IEEE (USD xx,xx) + CASS (USD xx,xx) = USD xx,xx per year
        Professional member: IEEE (USD xx,xx- electronic option) + CASS (USD
        xx,xx) = USD xx,xx per year.
      </p>
