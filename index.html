          <h2>Machine Learning applied to the Design of Integrated Circuits</h2>
          
            <p>The development of tools to aid the design of integrated circuits must deal with various optimization problems with multiple cost functions.</p>
            <p>With the increase in the scale of integration of integrated circuits, new methodologies, algorithms, and data structures are needed to assist the synthesis flow of integrated circuits.</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been an increase in the search for solutions combining machine learning techniques.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we will discuss the main synthesis flow tools, their optimization objectives, the dependence on graph-based data structures, the main contemporary challenges, and how machine learning techniques can be applied to help the integrated circuit synthesis flow achieve lower cost solutions and reduce design time.</p>
            <p>The challenges of integrating Machine Learning and trends in the field will also be highlighted.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to Chip Design Automation (EDA)</h2>
          <p>The design of contemporary VLSI circuits (chips), made up of dozens of general-purpose processors and dedicated processors, and with billions of transistors, requires the use of strict methodologies, based on the intensive use of EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.</p>
          <p>These tools, in turn, form a design flow that generally takes a top-down approach, starting with the description of system-level behavior, followed by architectural design, functional design, logic synthesis, technology mapping, and ending with physical design.</p>
          <p>Each of these stages receives a description at a given level of abstraction and automatically produces a new system description by adding functional and/or structural details, so that the final description can be used to manufacture the chip.</p>
          <p>In addition, the description generated at each stage also needs to be validated using verification techniques before moving on in the design flow.</p>
          <p>This course will cover the types of description used and the synthesis and verification processes carried out at each stage, as well as the associated EDA tools.</p>
          <p>The challenges of developing EDA tools for chip design in current and future technologies will also be addressed.</p>

            <p>José Luís Güntzel is a Full Professor in the Department of Informatics and Statistics (INE) at the Technology Center (CTC) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). He is supervisor of the Interdepartmental Microelectronics Center (NIME) at UFSC and a member of the Embedded Computing Laboratory (ECL) at UFSC. He has a degree in Electrical Engineering (1990), a master's degree (1993) and a doctorate (2000) in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). In 1996, he completed a doctoral internship at the Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Micro-électronique de Montpellier (LIRMM), Université Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France. Between 2017 and 2019 he was coordinator of the Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGCC) at UFSC. Between 2002 and 2007, he was an adjunct professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel).</p>

            <p>He is a senior member of the IEEE. He is a member of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, the IEEE Computer Society (CS), the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS), the IEEE Council for Electronic Design Automation (CEDA), the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and the Brazilian Microelectronics Society (SBMicro), of which he was a board member in 2006-2008.

            <h2>Trends in Computing and Microelectronics</h2>
            <p>The talk will cover some trends in Computing and Microelectronics, such as processor architectures, energy-saving strategies, optimization, critical systems, automated design, fault tolerance, embedded systems, alternative architectures (such as quantum systems, systemic systems) and hardware accelerators. Special emphasis will be placed on strategic technologies for the Internet of Things.</p>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) demands new challenges in the design of computing and electronic devices. One of the main challenges is reducing energy consumption, which has grown enormously as a result of the increasing number of devices connected to the internet, most of which are permanently connected. An overview will be given of design strategies (from software to component level) to reduce energy consumption, as well as to increase the reliability of IoT components, such as reducing the number of components in IoT devices. Optimization is a key word in the design of IT components in the IoT era.</p>
            <h2>Visualization tools </h2>
            <p>EDA (electronic design automation) tools have paved the way for the integration of billions of components into a single integrated circuit. However, many EDA tools still rely on text interfaces. The use of visualization tools helps not only to provide a visual output from an EDA tool, but also to show the tool's performance in terms of the quality of the results. Good graphical output is useful for improving algorithms or developing new ones. The talk is illustrated with several examples and animations, especially some logic cell positioning visualization tools. A perspective is provided on how these visualization tools have contributed to the improvement and development of new algorithms developed by our research team.</p>

      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Submit a poster highlighting your research in circuits and systems — engage with peers, exchange ideas, and gain insights from the community to strengthen your work!</strong> Selected authors will have the opportunity to exhibit their posters in the hall of the UFS rectorate, sharing their work and ideas with the Workshop audience and receiving valuable input and feedback. This is a great opportunity to expand your network and find new collaborators. Ongoing work is also welcome.</p>

        <p>Posters must be submitted electronically using an A4 portrait layout (21 cm × 29.7 cm) in PDF format, along with a 500-word abstract. Both the abstract and the poster may be written in English or Portuguese, and the presentation may be given in Portuguese.

After review by experts from the community, authors of selected works will present their posters in person during the event. Authors of accepted posters may submit a final version in A0 portrait layout (84.1 cm × 118.9 cm) by the camera-ready deadline so the organization can print and provide it free of charge. After this deadline, authors will be responsible for printing their own posters.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">No poster or abstract will be registered online, so authors can share their work with the local community without compromising the originality requirements of future conference or journal submissions.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">There is a mandatory template with predefined sections; authors may use the remaining space as they see fit.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>Note 1:</strong> The poster template is available in both PowerPoint and PDF formats. The poster must be submitted in PDF format, and the abstract must be submitted in PDF format as well. <br>
          <strong>Note 2:</strong> It is necessary to register for the workshop as well. We highly recommend that all authors register to secure their participation, as only the spot for the first author of approved posters is guaranteed.
